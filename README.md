### What does honeydet do?

honeydet is a signature based, multi-step, high interaction, multi-threaded honeypot detection tool written in Golang.
It can detect honeypots based upon the premise that, given a set of specifically crafted requests they will generate a unique and identifying response.
It can be run either as a web server, a command line tool, or as a web API.
Signatures support multi-step, hex, string and regex detection on TCP and UDP.
Features a SQL backend for persistent scans which can be managed through the web interface.
Shodan API integration for non-private IPs, automatically adds shodan host information when the flag is set (currently CLI only)

### Signatures
The signature list is growing as I run through different methods of fuzzing, reverse engineering and comparing real protocols and servers to their emulated counterparts. I continue to add features to the signature format as required, and will extend the applications support of protocols using additional libraries as needed for things like DICOM and Modbus.

### Frontend Features:
- Multi-threaded, and now super fast. /24 single port scan in around 1 second
- Supports single and multiple targets with csv, range, and CIDR
- Supports single and multiple ports with range and csv list
- Adjust execution options to ignore signature port mapping, pingtest host before test, threads, timeout and delay
- Pagination, table search and export
- Remove individual scans and clear database functionality

### Wish-list/To-do
* ~~Docker image and docker-compose file for simple installation~~
* SSL
* JA4+, HASSH, and other fingerprinting support
* Add shodan flag to frontend
* PDF Reports
* Active port detection (without requiring root), and passive port detection using Shodan API in place of specific ports or ranges

### Web Interface

### Installation

#### Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/referefref/honeydet.git
cd honeydet
go get honeydet
go build
```

#### Use docker compose
```bash
# Note that scans.db will persist in the docker-compose file directory, if you need to map this somewhere else, edit the docker compose file
git clone https://github.com/referefref/honeydet.git
cd honeydet
docker compose up
```

### Examples
* Scan a single host on port 2822 in verbose mode:
```
./honeydet -host 192.168.1.1 -port 2822 -verbose
```
* Scan a range of hosts in debug (extra verbose) mode:
```
./honeydet -host 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.30 -vv
```
* Scan hosts from a file with 100 threads checking for a ping before scanning, with a 5 second timeout, append shodan API information, and create a json report as report.json
```
./honeydet -hostfile hosts.txt -t 100 -T 5 -c -r json -o report.json -shodan
```
* Run in verbose webserver mode to expose an API endpoint:
```
./honeydet -webserver -verbose
curl 'http://localhost:8080/scan?targets=10.1.1.1/24&report=json&port=3389'
```

## How to write a signature
Any contibutions to the signatures and detection logic are welcomed and will be integrated with proof, just submit the yaml as a PR.
Unique signature id's will be allocated upon collation of submitted signatures. If there's enough interest, i'll add author and reference url fields to the signature.

Add a new section to signatures.yaml or create a new signature yaml file with the following format
```yaml
signatures:
  - name: "signature name"
    id: 1337
    port: port number
    proto: udp/tcp
    steps:
      - input_type: string/hex
        input: "input string or hex value"
        output_match_type: string/hex/regex
        output: "output match string, hex value or regex expression"
        invert_match: false
      - input_type: string/hex
        input: "second step input"
        output_match_type: string/hex/regex
        output: "output match string for step 2"
        invert_match: false
  confidence: "High/Medium/Low"
  comment: "Comment explaining the signature and its detection mechanism"
```
